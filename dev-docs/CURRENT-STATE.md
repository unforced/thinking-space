## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor
1. **Port conflicts** - Vite tries multiple ports if 5173 is busy (works fine)
2. **Empty icon files** - Placeholder icon is simple but works
3. **Dark mode toggle** - Respects system preference but no manual toggle yet

### Not Bugs (By Design)
1. **Placeholder AI responses** - Agent SDK integration is next phase
2. **No file attachments yet** - Coming in file operations phase
3. **No search** - Deferred to post-MVP

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Tauri 2 is excellent** - Fast, small bundles, great DX
2. **Zustand is perfect for this** - Simpler than Redux, powerful enough
3. **React 18 + TypeScript** - Solid foundation, good tooling
4. **Rust + JSON-RPC** - Clean separation, type-safe communication

### Design Insights

1. **Spatial metaphor works** - "Spaces" makes immediate sense
2. **CLAUDE.md is the key** - Context per Space is powerful
3. **Simplicity > features** - Starting minimal was right call
4. **Claude Desktop aesthetic** - Users will feel at home

### Process Insights

1. **Documentation first** - Vision/architecture docs paid off
2. **MVP scope discipline** - Saying "no" to features helped
3. **Incremental commits** - Clear history makes debugging easy
4. **Test as you go** - Manual testing caught issues early

## 💡 Ideas for Future

These came up during development but are out of scope for MVP:

- **Collaboration**: Share Spaces with others
- **Sync**: Optional cloud backup/sync
- **Mobile**: Companion app for iOS/Android
- **Plugins**: Extension system
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights
- **Multi-agent**: Support for Gemini, Goose, etc via ACP
- **Voice**: Voice input/output
- **Canvas**: Visual thinking tools

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The MVP will be successful when:

1. ✅ A non-developer can install and run it
2. ✅ Creating a Space is obvious and quick
3. ✅ The mental model of Spaces makes sense
4. 🔲 Claude responds with real, contextual answers (Agent SDK)
5. 🔲 File operations work smoothly
6. ✅ The UI feels polished and professional
7. ✅ It's stable enough for daily use

**Current Status**: 5/7 criteria met

## 🙏 Thank You

This has been an incredibly productive session. We went from zero to a fully functional MVP foundation in a single sitting. The architecture is solid, the code is clean, and the vision is clear.

**Next person who picks this up**: You have a great foundation to build on. The hard decisions are made, the infrastructure is in place, and the path forward is clear. Good luck! 🚀
