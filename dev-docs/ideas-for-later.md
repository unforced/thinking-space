## My Top 3 Recommendations

If I had to pick **just 3 features** to build next:

### 🥇 #1: Space Canvas (B1)
**Why:** This is the **defining feature** of Thinking Space. It makes the spatial metaphor real and tangible. It's what people will screenshot and share. It's beautiful, unique, and directly supports the memory palace concept.

**Impact:** Transforms Thinking Space from "another AI app" to "a completely new way to think with AI."

---

### 🥈 #2: Multi-Space Conversations (C1)
**Why:** Incredibly powerful and **unique to our architecture**. No other AI app lets you synthesize across multiple contexts simultaneously. This enables workflows impossible elsewhere.

**Impact:** Opens entirely new use cases. Newsletter writers can reference research + personal experiences. Consultants can combine client context + industry knowledge.

---

### 🥉 #3: Space Templates Library (B3)
**Why:** **Lowers barrier to entry** dramatically. People learn by example. A rich template library teaches users what's possible and gets them productive immediately.

**Impact:** Faster adoption, better onboarding, community growth through sharing.

---

## Bonus: The "Wow" Factor Feature

### Space Time-Travel View
**Concept:** Scrub through a Space's conversation history like a video timeline. Watch ideas evolve. See what you were thinking about on specific days.

**Visual:** Timeline slider at bottom of chat. Drag to travel through time. Messages fade in/out. CLAUDE.md shows past versions.

**Why it's special:**
- Incredibly cool demo
- Makes conversation history tangible
- Supports reflection and learning
- No other app has this

**Effort:** Medium-High (10-15 hours)
**When:** After 1.0, for the "wow" factor

---

## Questions for You

1. **Which category excites you most?** Desktop Parity, Spatial Thinking, or Power User?

2. **Space Canvas (B1) - too ambitious for 0.2?** It's high effort but potentially transformative.

3. **Should we prioritize Claude Desktop parity first?** Or lean into our unique spatial features?

4. **Collaboration (C5) - worth exploring?** Or keep it local-first forever?

5. **Any other "Thinking Space" concepts I'm missing?** What does spatial thinking mean to you?

---

**Ready to build the future of thinking with AI!** 🚀
