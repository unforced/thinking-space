# Missing Features Analysis - Thinking Space vs Zed/Claude Code

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Recommendations Ready

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented the **core ACP v2 integration** with all essential features working:
- ‚úÖ Streaming messages
- ‚úÖ Tool call display
- ‚úÖ Permission dialogs with auto-approval
- ‚úÖ Permission queue for simultaneous requests
- ‚úÖ File operations (read/write)
- ‚úÖ Error handling

However, there are several **high-value features** from Zed's ACP implementation and Claude Code that we should consider adding to enhance the user experience and match industry standards.

---

## Current State: What We Have ‚úÖ

### Core ACP Features Implemented
1. **Basic Communication**
   - Streaming message responses
   - Session management
   - Request/response correlation

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Tool call notifications with UI display
   - Tool status updates (running/success/failed)
   - Inline tool call visualization

3. **Permission System**
   - Permission request dialogs (Zed-style inline)
   - Auto-approval for safe operations (reads, searches, safe bash)
   - Permission queue for handling multiple simultaneous requests
   - Manual approval for unsafe operations (writes, destructive commands)

4. **File Operations**

## Missing Features: Priority Analysis

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Should Implement Soon

#### 1. **MCP Server Integration**
**What It Is:**
- Model Context Protocol allows connecting Claude to external tools/data sources
- Examples: GitHub, Sentry, databases, Linear, Notion, Slack
- Hundreds of pre-built MCP servers available

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

**Why Important:**
- Major feature of Claude Code that users expect
- Enables powerful workflows (query databases, create GitHub issues, etc.)
- Industry standard - Anthropic is pushing MCP heavily

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High
- ACP library supports MCP servers
- Need UI for managing server connections
- Need configuration file support (`.mcp.json`)
- Need environment variable expansion
- Need OAuth flow for authenticated servers

**User Value:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very High)
- Dramatically expands what users can do
- Critical for professional use cases
- Expected feature parity with Claude Code

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT** - This is a must-have for competitive parity

---

#### 2. **Slash Commands**
**What It Is:**
- Custom commands stored as markdown files in `.claude/commands/`
- Type `/` to see menu of available commands
- Can include arguments with `$ARGUMENTS` keyword
- MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented

**Why Important:**
- Users love slash commands for repeated workflows
- Makes the app feel more powerful and customizable
- Team can share commands via git
- Low effort, high perceived value

**Implementation Complexity:** Low-Medium
- Create `.claude/commands/` directory in each Space
- File picker or editor for creating/editing command files
- Parse markdown files and extract content
- Display command palette when user types `/`
- Replace `$ARGUMENTS` with user input

**User Value:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)
- Empowers users to create custom workflows
- Feels professional and powerful
- Shareable with team

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT** - Low effort, high value

---

#### 3. **Multi-Buffer Diff View**
**What It Is:**
- Zed shows file changes in a multi-buffer with syntax highlighting
- Side-by-side diff view for reviewing changes
- Can approve/reject individual changes
- Integrates with language servers for full IDE experience

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not implemented (we just show tool calls)

**Why Important:**
- Core value proposition of editor-based ACP vs CLI
- Users want to see and control changes
- Trust and transparency

**Implementation Complexity:** High
- Need Monaco editor or similar for diff view

- Key differentiator from CLI

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT LATER** - High value but complex, do after MCP and slash commands

---

#### 4. **Session Persistence**
**What It Is:**
- Save and restore ACP sessions across app restarts
- Resume conversations exactly where you left off
- Session history browsing

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (we save conversation messages but not ACP session state)

**Why Important:**
- Users expect persistence
- Matches Claude Desktop behavior
- Reduces friction

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium
- ACP supports session IDs
- Need to serialize/deserialize session state
- Need UI for session management
- Need cleanup of old sessions

**User Value:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)
