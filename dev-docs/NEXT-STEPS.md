### ⚠️ What's Missing (MVP Blockers)

1. **Markdown Rendering** 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
   - Currently showing plain text
   - Code blocks not syntax highlighted
   - Bold/italic not rendered
   - Lists appear as plain text
   - **Impact**: Makes conversations harder to read, especially code examples
   - **Effort**: ~2-3 hours

2. **File Operations** 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
   - Can't attach files to messages yet
   - Can't use Read/Write tools effectively
   - No permission UI for file access
   - **Impact**: Major feature gap from MVP spec
   - **Effort**: ~1-2 days

3. **Permission System UI** 🔥 MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Currently auto-approves all tools
   - No user visibility into what's being allowed
   - No way to deny/control permissions
   - **Impact**: Users can't control what Claude can do
   - **Effort**: ~1 day

4. **Settings Panel** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - No API key fallback
   - Can't configure theme manually
   - Can't see data location
   - **Impact**: Less flexibility, but Claude Code auth works
   - **Effort**: ~4-6 hours

5. **Error Handling Polish** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Basic errors shown but not actionable
   - No retry mechanism
   - Network errors not user-friendly
   - **Impact**: Poor UX when things go wrong
   - **Effort**: ~4 hours

### 📊 MVP Completion Checklist

Based on `03-mvp-scope.md`:

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Space Management (100%)
- ✅ Chat Interface (90% - needs markdown)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md Editor (100%)
- ❌ File Operations (0%)
- ⚠️ Settings Panel (50% - auth works, but no UI)

**Must-Have Features:**
- ✅ Stable Agent SDK integration
- ✅ Data persistence
- ✅ Good performance
- ⚠️ Error recovery (basic, needs polish)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Non-developer can create Space and chat < 2 minutes
- ✅ "Spaces" mental model makes sense
- ✅ Contextual responses (conversation history working)
- ❌ File operations work smoothly (not implemented yet)
- ⚠️ UI feels polished (good, but needs markdown rendering)

**Current MVP Status: 80% Complete**

## 💡 Decision Points

### A. Markdown Rendering Library Choice

**Option 1: react-markdown** (Recommended)
- ✅ Popular, well-maintained
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ✅ Easy syntax highlighting integration
- ❌ Slightly larger bundle

**Option 2: marked + DOMPurify**
- ✅ Smaller bundle
- ✅ More control
- ❌ More manual work
- ❌ Security concerns (need DOMPurify)

**Recommendation**: Use `react-markdown` with `react-syntax-highlighter` for quick, safe implementation.

### B. Permission System Architecture

**Option 1: Modal Dialogs** (Recommended for MVP)
- ✅ Clear, blocking UX
- ✅ Matches Zed's approach
- ✅ User must respond
- ❌ Interrupts flow

**Option 2: Toast Notifications**
- ✅ Less intrusive
- ❌ Easy to miss
- ❌ Complex state management

**Recommendation**: Modal dialogs with keyboard shortcuts for power users.

### C. File Attachment Limits

**Option 1: No limits** (Accept anything)
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ❌ Can cause errors with huge files
- ❌ Performance issues

**Option 2: Reasonable limits** (Recommended)
- ✅ Prevents common issues
- ✅ Better UX with clear feedback
- Suggested: 10 files max, 10MB per file

**Recommendation**: Set reasonable limits with clear error messages.

## 📊 Success Metrics for MVP Launch

Track these to validate the concept:

### Quantitative
1. **Activation**: % of users who create first Space
2. **Retention**: % using app 1 week later
3. **Engagement**: Avg messages per session
4. **Stickiness**: Spaces created per user
5. **Performance**: Avg response time, crash rate

### Qualitative
1. Do users understand the Spaces concept?
2. What features do they request first?
3. What confuses them?
4. Would they recommend it?
