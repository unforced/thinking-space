# Documentation Guide

Welcome to Thinking Space documentation. Everything is organized for clarity and maintainability.

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Living Documents (Update Frequently)
These are the "single source of truth" - always current, updated after changes.

- **[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** ‚≠ê **START HERE**
  - What's built, what's not, priorities
  - Updated after every feature completion
  - Check this at the start of each session

### Evergreen Documents (Rarely Change)
Core principles and architecture - stable reference material.

- **[VISION.md](VISION.md)** - Why this exists, design philosophy
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - How it's built technically
- **[MVP-SCOPE.md](MVP-SCOPE.md)** - What we're building in v1

### Historical Documents (Never Update)
Point-in-time records for understanding past decisions.

- **[archive/planning/](archive/planning/)** - Pre-build research
- **[archive/sessions/](archive/sessions/)** - Development session notes

## üéØ Quick Navigation

**I want to...**

- **Understand current state** ‚Üí Read [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
- **Start contributing** ‚Üí Read [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) + [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Understand the vision** ‚Üí Read [VISION.md](VISION.md)
- **See what's in MVP** ‚Üí Read [MVP-SCOPE.md](MVP-SCOPE.md)
- **Find implementation details** ‚Üí Check [archive/sessions/](archive/sessions/)
- **See research/decisions** ‚Üí Check [archive/planning/](archive/planning/)

## üìù Documentation Principles

### Living Docs Rules
- Must have "Last Updated" date at top
- Update immediately after changes
- Keep concise (detailed history goes in archive)
- Maximum 1 doc per purpose (no duplicates)

### Evergreen Docs Rules
- Write once, update only for major changes
- Can be longer and more detailed
- Timeless principles, not current state

### Historical Docs Rules
- Never update after creation
- Include date in context
- Useful for "why did we decide X?"
- Optional reading

## ‚úÖ When to Update What

**After completing a feature:**
1. Update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) - move from "Not Built" to "Built"
2. Update [../README.md](../README.md) if user-facing
3. Archive implementation notes in `archive/sessions/` if detailed

**After major architectural change:**
1. Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
3. Document the decision in a session note

**After scope change:**
1. Update [MVP-SCOPE.md](MVP-SCOPE.md)
2. Update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) priorities

## üîç Document Summaries

### STATUS.md (Living)
Current implementation state. Includes:
- What's built (by feature area)
- What's not built (MVP gaps)
- Known issues
- Next 3-5 priorities
- Completion estimate

**Update:** After every feature or bug fix

### VISION.md (Evergreen)
Product philosophy. Includes:
- Problem statement
- Core insights (Extended Mind, spatial thinking)
- Solution overview
- Design principles

**Update:** Rarely (only if vision pivots)

### ARCHITECTURE.md (Evergreen)
Technical design. Includes:
- Tech stack
- System architecture
- Data flow
- File structure
- Key patterns

**Update:** Major architectural changes only

### MVP-SCOPE.md (Evergreen)
V1 feature scope. Includes:
- What's in scope
- What's deferred
- Success criteria
- Development phases

**Update:** When scope changes (rare)

## üì¶ Archive Organization

### archive/planning/
Research and decisions from planning phase:
- `00-research-findings.md` - Pre-build research

### archive/sessions/
Development session notes:
- `SESSION-2-SUMMARY.md` - Foundation work
- `SESSION-3-SUMMARY.md` - Agent SDK integration
- `SESSION-4-SUMMARY.md` - Streaming fixed

Add new session notes here if they contain valuable implementation details or decisions.

## üö´ What NOT to Do

‚ùå Don't create duplicate "status" docs
‚ùå Don't leave outdated information in living docs
‚ùå Don't update historical docs
‚ùå Don't create docs without clear purpose
‚ùå Don't forget "Last Updated" dates on living docs

---

## ‚ú® Benefits of This Structure

- **Single source of truth** - Only one STATUS.md
- **Clear categories** - Know what to update vs archive
- **Reduced confusion** - No duplicate or outdated docs
- **Easy navigation** - Logical structure
- **Standard practices** - Follows common open source patterns
- **AI-friendly** - Clear which docs to reference
