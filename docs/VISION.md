## The Problem

### Claude Code is More Powerful Than Claude Desktop

People are discovering that Claude Code (now the Claude Agent SDK) is significantly more effective than Claude Desktop—even for non-technical tasks. As one Every.to writer put it: "The cloud app is like a hotel room—clean, set up for you, but you start fresh each time. Claude Code is like having your own apartment with AI in it."

**Why Claude Code is more powerful:**
- No arbitrary file size limits
- Full access to local file system
- Can process massive datasets locally
- Persistent memory through CLAUDE.md files
- Custom slash commands for repeatable workflows
- Lives in *your* space with *your* context

**Real-world non-developer use cases:**
- Expense tracking and categorization from credit card CSVs
- Content performance analysis on large datasets
- Customer support research across codebases
- Marketing content generation from product updates
- Personal knowledge management and research compilation

### But Claude Code Has Barriers

The CLI interface creates friction:
- Terminal commands intimidate non-developers
- File organization becomes chaotic without guidance
- No visual navigation of workspaces
- Context switching is manual and error-prone
- Lacks the polish and approachability of Claude Desktop

### The Gap

There's a space between:
- **Claude Desktop**: Beautiful, simple, but limited
- **Claude Code**: Powerful, flexible, but intimidating

We need something that combines the power of Claude Code with the approachability of Claude Desktop.

## The Insight: Extended Mind + Memory Palace

### Thinking with Spaces

Annie Murphy Paul's "The Extended Mind" argues that our best thinking doesn't happen solely in our heads—it happens when we engage with:
- Our bodies
- Our physical surroundings
- Other minds
- External tools and structures

The method of loci (memory palace technique) works because spatial memory is deeply ingrained in human cognition. We remember places, and places help us think.

### A Digital Memory Palace That's Also a Thinking Space

The insight: create a digital environment that leverages spatial thinking, where:
- **Each Space is a room in your memory palace**
- **Each room has context** (via CLAUDE.md)
- **Claude knows where it is** and adapts accordingly
- **You think actively in these spaces**, not just store information
- **Spaces accumulate your work** organically

This isn't just a file organizer or note-taking app. It's a **place you go to think with AI**.

## The Solution: Thinking Space

### Core Concept

**Thinking Space** is a desktop application that wraps the Claude Agent SDK in a beautiful, spatial interface. It provides:

1. **Spaces** - Named contexts for different aspects of your life/work
2. **Memory** - Each Space has a CLAUDE.md that gives Claude context
3. **Simplicity** - Claude Desktop-level approachability
4. **Power** - Full Claude Agent SDK capabilities under the hood

### The Spatial Metaphor

```
Thinking Space
└── Your Spaces/
    ├── Book Research/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md          ← "This is research for a book on..."
    │   ├── notes/
    │   └── sources/
    ├── Newsletter Writing/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md          ← "This is for my weekly newsletter..."
    │   └── drafts/
    └── Personal Finance/
        ├── CLAUDE.md          ← "This is for tracking expenses..."
        └── statements/
```

Each Space:
- Has a clear purpose
- Contains relevant files and context
- Tells Claude what you're trying to do there
- Becomes a place you return to for that kind of thinking

### Not Just Storage, But Active Thinking

Unlike traditional second brain tools (Notion, Obsidian, etc.) that focus on *organizing information you already have*, Thinking Space is where you:
- **Generate new thoughts** in conversation with Claude
- **Process information** (analyze datasets, categorize expenses, synthesize research)
- **Create output** (write drafts, generate reports, build systems)
- **Refine over time** (each Space gets smarter as its CLAUDE.md evolves)

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- No steep learning curve
- Approachable for non-developers
- Clear mental model (Spaces = places to think)
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features

### 2. Spatial Memory
- Leverage human spatial cognition
- Each Space has distinct context
- Visual navigation feels natural
- Return to a Space = return to that context

### 3. Intentionality Over Chaos
- CLAUDE.md prevents file sprawl
- Each Space has clear purpose
- Guided creation, not overwhelming freedom
- Structure emerges from use, not imposed upfront

### 4. Local First
- All data lives on your machine
- Privacy by design
- Fast and responsive
- No cloud dependencies (at first)

### 5. Flexible, Not Prescriptive
- No forced PARA or GTD methodology
- Create Spaces as you need them
- Organize however makes sense to you
- The structure serves you, not vice versa

## The User Experience

### First Launch

1. Welcome screen explains the concept
2. "Create your first Space"
3. Choose a template (Quick Start or Custom)
4. Name your Space
5. Start thinking/chatting

### Daily Use

**Morning:**
- Open Thinking Space
- See your Spaces in the sidebar
- Click "Newsletter Writing"
- Claude already knows this is your newsletter context
- Ask: "What should I write about this week based on recent conversations?"

**During Research:**
- Switch to "Book Research" Space
- Attach PDFs and articles
- Ask: "Summarize the key arguments across these sources"
- Claude processes everything locally, no file size limits

**Evening:**
- Visit "Personal Finance" Space
- Drop in credit card CSV
- Say: "Categorize these like we did last month"
- Claude remembers the categories from CLAUDE.md

### Over Time

- Spaces accumulate context naturally
- CLAUDE.md files evolve with your needs
- You develop a spatial memory: "I think about X in that Space"
- The tool becomes an extension of your mind

## What This Isn't

- **Not a code editor** (though you can use it for coding)
- **Not a file manager** (though files live in Spaces)
- **Not a task manager** (though you can manage tasks)
- **Not a note-taking app** (though you can take notes)

It's a **thinking environment**. The AI-powered room where you do your cognitive work.

## Success Criteria

We'll know this works when:

1. **Non-developers adopt it naturally**
   - No tutorial needed beyond the welcome screen
   - Mental model clicks immediately
   - Daily use feels effortless

2. **People develop spatial memory**
   - "I think about finances in that Space"
   - Context switching becomes automatic
   - Returning to a Space feels like coming home

3. **Claude becomes more effective**
   - Responses are more contextual
   - Less re-explaining needed
   - Workflows improve over time

4. **Use cases beyond coding emerge**
   - Personal knowledge management
   - Research and analysis
   - Creative writing
   - Life organization

## The Path Forward

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Basic Spaces management
- Claude Agent SDK integration
- Simple chat interface
- CLAUDE.md editing

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Improved context management
- File handling and preview
- Search and navigation
- Template library

### Phase 3: Ecosystem
- MCP server integration
- Custom commands/workflows
- Sharing and collaboration
- Cross-device sync (maybe)
