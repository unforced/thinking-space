---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Agent Service Architecture

```typescript
// agentService.ts
class AgentService {
  async *sendMessage(message, options) {
    const session = query({
      prompt: message,
      options: {
        model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
        systemPrompt: claudeMdContent,
        workingDirectory: spacePath,
        allowedTools: ['Read', 'Write', 'Grep', 'Bash'],
        maxTurns: 10
      }
    })

    for await (const event of session) {
      if (event.type === 'text') yield event.text
      if (event.type === 'result') yield event.result
    }
  }
}
```

### Chat Store Integration

```typescript
// chatStore.ts
sendMessage: async (content) => {
  // 1. Add user message
  // 2. Read CLAUDE.md for context
  // 3. Stream from Agent SDK
  // 4. Update UI in real-time
  // 5. Add complete assistant message
}
```

### Streaming UI Pattern

```typescript
// ChatArea.tsx
{streaming && currentStreamingMessage && (
  <div className="...">
    {currentStreamingMessage}
    <div className="animate-pulse">...</div>
  </div>
)}
```

## üí° Example Use Cases (Now Actually Work!)

### 1. Personal Research Assistant

**Space**: "Research Helper"

**CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
# Research Helper

## Purpose
This Space is for conducting research and analyzing information.

## Context
I'm researching AI agent architectures and spatial thinking concepts.

## Guidelines
- Provide detailed, well-researched answers
- Include citations when possible
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
```

**Conversation**:
- User: "Explain the method of loci and why it works"
- Claude: [Gives detailed, research-focused explanation]

### 2. Writing Assistant

**Space**: "Newsletter Writing"

**CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
# Newsletter Writing

## Purpose
This Space is for drafting and editing my weekly newsletter.

## Context
- Newsletter is about AI and productivity
- Audience is tech-savvy professionals
- Tone should be conversational but informative

## Guidelines
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use specific examples
- End with actionable takeaways
```

**Conversation**:
- User: "Help me write about AI memory systems"
- Claude: [Provides newsletter-style draft with the right tone]

### 3. Code Review

**Space**: "Code Review"

**CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
# Code Review

## Purpose
Review and improve code quality.

## Context
Working on TypeScript/React projects.

## Guidelines

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

These are now optional improvements, not blockers:

### Short Term
- File attachments in chat
- Session history per Space
- Search across conversations
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Medium Term
- MCP server management UI
- Custom tool creation
- Usage analytics
- Export conversations

### Long Term
- Multi-agent support (via ACP)
- Collaboration features
- Cloud sync (optional)
- Mobile companion app

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **API key visibility**: Stored in memory during session (secure enough for now)
2. **No session persistence**: Messages cleared on Space switch (by design for MVP)
3. **Tool execution**: User doesn't see tool calls explicitly (could add later)
4. **No file preview**: Can attach but not preview (future feature)

### Not Bugs, By Design
- Messages don't persist between sessions (keeps it simple)
- One conversation per Space at a time (focuses thinking)
- No undo/redo (can regenerate)
- No export yet (coming later)

None of these block real usage!

## üìù Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Agent SDK Integration**: Straightforward once we understood the API
2. **Streaming Pattern**: Async generators work beautifully
3. **Store Architecture**: Zustand makes state management simple
4. **TypeScript**: Caught errors before runtime

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Streaming UI**: Required careful state management
2. **Error Handling**: Needed user-friendly messages
3. **API Key Security**: Proper storage consideration
4. **Context Loading**: Timing of CLAUDE.md reads

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
2. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation
3. **Loading States**: Always show what's happening
4. **User Feedback**: Clear messages and indicators

---

## üéì Technical Highlights

### Agent Service Pattern

The abstraction we created is clean and extensible:

```typescript
interface AgentService {
  sendMessage(): AsyncGenerator<string>
  sendMessageSync(): Promise<string>
}
```

This allows:
- Easy testing (mock the service)
- Future agent swapping
- Streaming or blocking modes
- Clean separation of concerns

### Store Integration

The chatStore cleanly orchestrates:
1. User input validation
2. CLAUDE.md context loading
3. Agent service streaming
4. UI state updates
5. Error handling

Single responsibility at each layer.

### Component Design

ChatArea shows streaming without knowing about Agent SDK:
- Receives `currentStreamingMessage` from store
- Updates UI reactively
- No tight coupling
- Easy to test

---

## üìä Comparison to Goals

### Original Vision (from dev-docs/01-vision.md)

| Goal | Status | Notes |
