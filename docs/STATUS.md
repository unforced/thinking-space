## 🔴 What's Not Built (MVP Gaps)

### Critical for MVP Launch

1. **Welcome Screen / Onboarding**
   - ❌ No first-time user experience
   - ❌ No setup wizard
   - ❌ Empty states need improvement
   - **Impact:** Poor first impression for new users
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours

### Important But Deferred

2. **Permission System UI**
   - ❌ No permission dialogs for file access
   - ❌ Currently auto-allows everything in Space directory
   - ❌ No way to control tool permissions
   - **Impact:** Security/privacy concern, no user control
   - **Effort:** 6-8 hours
   - **Note:** Defer to post-MVP - current auto-allow is acceptable for early users

### Nice to Have (Post-MVP)

- Message timestamps on hover
- Space deletion confirmation dialog
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N, Cmd+K, Cmd+,)
- Better error recovery UI (retry failed messages)
- Message editing/regeneration
- Search across Spaces

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **No file permission dialogs** - Should ask before accessing files outside Space (deferred)
2. **Bundle size warning** - 570KB (acceptable but could optimize with code splitting)

---

## 🎯 Next Priorities

### Immediate (This Session)

1. ✅ ~~Fix conversation history persistence~~ - **COMPLETE!**
2. ✅ ~~Fix Space timestamp bug~~ - **COMPLETE!**
3. ✅ ~~Complete settings panel~~ - **COMPLETE!**
4. **Build welcome screen** - First-time UX, onboarding (4-6 hours)

### Near-Term (Next Session)

5. **Manual testing pass** - Full user flow validation
6. **Documentation update** - README, troubleshooting

### Pre-Launch

7. **Performance optimization** - If needed
8. **Build and package** - Create installers
9. **Permission system UI** - Deferred to post-MVP
