## 🔴 What's Not Built (MVP Gaps)

### Critical for MVP Launch

1. **Conversation History Persistence**
   - ❌ Messages don't persist after closing app
   - ❌ Switching Spaces loses current conversation
   - **Impact:** Can't return to previous conversations
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours (need to design storage strategy)

2. **Settings Panel Completion**
   - ⚠️ UI exists but incomplete
   - ❌ API key input not wired up
   - ❌ Theme toggle not implemented
   - ❌ Settings don't persist to disk
   - ❌ No "Open Data Folder" button
   - **Impact:** Users can't configure without Claude Code auth
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours

3. **Permission System UI**
   - ❌ No permission dialogs for file access
   - ❌ Currently auto-allows everything in Space directory
   - ❌ No way to control tool permissions
   - **Impact:** Security/privacy concern, no user control
   - **Effort:** 6-8 hours

4. **Welcome Screen / Onboarding**
   - ❌ No first-time user experience
   - ❌ No setup wizard
   - ❌ Empty states need improvement
   - **Impact:** Poor first impression for new users
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours

### Nice to Have (Post-MVP)

- Message timestamps on hover
- Space deletion confirmation dialog
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N, Cmd+K, Cmd+,)
- Better error recovery UI (retry failed messages)
- Message editing/regeneration
- Session history within Spaces
- Search across Spaces

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Space timestamp bug** - Shows "1970" until Space is clicked (initialization issue)
2. **Conversation doesn't persist** - Resets on app restart or Space switch
3. **Settings don't save** - Currently in-memory only
4. **No file permission dialogs** - Should ask before accessing files outside Space
5. **Bundle size warning** - 569KB (acceptable but could optimize with code splitting)

---

## 🎯 Next Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Fix conversation history persistence** - Critical for usability
2. **Complete settings panel** - Enable API key fallback, theme control
3. **Fix Space timestamp bug** - Quick win for polish

### Near-Term (Next Week)
4. **Add permission system UI** - Essential for security
5. **Build welcome screen** - Better first-time experience
6. **Add keyboard shortcuts** - Power user feature

### Pre-Launch (Week After)
7. **Manual testing pass** - Full user flow validation
8. **Performance optimization** - Ensure smooth experience
9. **Documentation update** - README, setup guide, troubleshooting
10. **Build and package** - Create installers for macOS/Windows/Linux
